# Using Code Spaces on your repository
During this Technical Bootcamp, you have already had some hands-on experience working with Code Spaces. In this hands-on lab, we'll dive a bit deeper and have the goal to have you  extend your Code Spaces installation with a plugin you not already have installed. 

Navigate to your Code Space. If you have not yet started your Code Space, from your repository on the tab `Code`, click the `Code` button, select `Code Spaces` and `New codespace`.

Go to `Settings` and to `Extensions` 

Search for the term "markdown" and select the "Markdown all in one" extension.

Click `install in codespace` and subsequently `add to devcontainer.json`. 

Rebuild container to apply them now

This will not only install the extension for now, but will ensure this extension is always available when you open your Code Space.
