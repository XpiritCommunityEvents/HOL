# Creating a custom mapping to override the default behavior or non existing mappings
In this lab you will create a custom plugin that transforms some of the exising migration mapping and replace it by your own mapping. 
For this you need to start coding  in Ruby.

## Creating a mapping
To create a maping you need to create a ruby file that looks as follows:
``` ruby
transform "AzureResourceGroupDeployment@2" do |item|
    {
      uses: "azure/arm-deploy@v1",
      with:
      {
        subscriptionId: "#{item['ConnectedServiceName']}",
        resourceGroupName: "#{item['resourceGroupName']}",
        template: "#{item['csmFile']}"
      }
    }
  end
