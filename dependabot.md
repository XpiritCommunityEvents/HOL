# Enabling and using Dependabot on your repository
The hands-on lab has the goal to learn you how to enable the Dependency and Dependabot features and gain hands-on experience with Dependatbot's ability to update your dependencies automatically.

## Enabling the Dependency features
Let's start with enabling the following features on your repository. When you navigate to the `Security` tab on your repository, under the `Configure security and analysis features` you will find the following features. Go ahead and click `Enable` for each of these features:
* Dependency graph
* Dependabot alerts
* Dependabot security updates

Now that you have enabled the Dependabot features, let's have some hands-on experience with this functionality.

## Dependabot alerts
Dependabot alerts track security vulnerabilities that apply to your repositoryâ€™s dependencies. When you navigate to the `Security` tab on your repository, and click `Dependabot alerts`, you can see the active alerts generated by Dependabot.

When you click on an alert, you can see the details on that alert. Let's have a look at an example alert. Dependabot will show you details on the vulnerability and a suggested remediation. Review the details of the vulnerability and, if available, the pull request containing the automated security update. Optionally, if there isn't already a Dependabot security updates update for the alert, to create a pull request to resolve the vulnerability, click `Create Dependabot security update`.

Navigate to the pull request that was generated by Dependabot. Here's an example:

When you're ready to update your dependency and resolve the vulnerability, merge the pull request. 

## Dependabot security updates
When GitHub generates a Dependabot alert for a vulnerable dependency in your repository, Dependabot can automatically try to fix it for you. Dependabot security updates are automatically generated pull requests that update a vulnerable dependency to a fixed version. The Dependabot security updates feature is available for repositories where you have enabled the dependency graph and Dependabot alerts. 

You will see a Dependabot alert for every vulnerable dependency identified in your full dependency graph. However, security updates are triggered only for dependencies that are specified in a manifest or lock file. Dependabot is unable to update an indirect or transitive dependency that is not explicitly defined. 


## If time permits: Always assign Dependabot alerts to a person
By default, Dependabot raises pull requests without any reviewers or assignees. In this part of the hands-on lab, let's make use of the ability to configure Dependabot to always assign Dependabot alerts to a person. You can perform this kind of configuration using the `dependabot.yml` file. You must store this file in the `.github` directory of your repository. When you add or update the `dependabot.yml` file, this triggers an immediate check for version updates.

You can use reviewers and assignees to specify reviewers and assignees for all pull requests raised. You can also specify a team but When you specify a team, you must use the full team name, as if you were @mentioning the team (including the organization). 

The example dependabot.yml file below changes the npm configuration so that all pull requests opened with version and security updates for npm will have two reviewers and one assignee.

...
# dependabot.yml file with
# reviews and an assignee for all npm pull requests

version: 2
updates:
  # Keep npm dependencies up to date
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
    # Raise all npm pull requests with reviewers
    reviewers:
      - "my-org/team-name"
      - "octocat"
    # Raise all npm pull requests with an assignee
    assignees:
      - "user-name"
...

Now, go ahead and try to always assign Dependabot alerts to yourself using configuration via the `dependabot.yml` file.
