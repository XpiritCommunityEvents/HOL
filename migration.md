# Migrating pipelines from Azure DevOps to GitHub Actions using Valet 
In this hands-on lab you will get a first glance at the tooling that is build to migrate CI/CD solutions to GitHub actions. This tool is called **Valet**.

We will start with setting up the tools, use the tools for a dry-run and do a migration of one pipeline to Azure DevOps to get a feel on how the tools work.

All the hands-on labs will use the CodeSpaces capability of GitHub. During the import of the git repository, we more or less sneaked in the configuration for the codespaces setup. This is done because we included a folder called .devcontainer. This contains the setup of our development environment for this hands-on exercise.
So before we continue the hands-on lab, go to your repository and start your Codespace instance by clicking the button "create new Codespace"

![starting codespaces](images/codespaces.png)

The first time you create a Codespace You will see the following screen.

![creating codespace container](images/settingup-codespaces.png)
Please wait for this to complete. The reason it takes some more time the first time has to do with the fact the container needs to be build for the first time. Next time you start a Codespace you will get access in a few seconds.

When your Codespace is ready you will see the full IDE appear in your browser. This is a full Visual Studio Code experience in your browser! This looks as follows:

The place where we will do all our work for this hands-on lab is in the terminal window, that you can find in the right bottom part. It should show you a command-line and it is currently in the folder /workspaces/<your-repo-name> (main)
  
> Note: All command-line steps assume the above environment to work. So please ensure this is the case before you start.

## Adding Valet to your development environment.

Valet uses a Docker container to do all the work. This container is available the moment you are onboarded to Valet.
Valet consist primarily out of two things we need to setup before we can do some work:
- A Docker image that we need on our machine
- A script called Valet, that drives the use of the Docker container on our workstation.

Let us get started by setting up the tools so they work.

### Pulling the docker image for Valet

In the terminal window in your Codespace environment (or in Visual Studio Code if you prefer to use that)
type at the command-line:
> docker images
This should return an empty list of images
```
codespace âžœ /workspaces/<your repo name> (main) $ docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID   CREATED   SIZE
  ```

now pull the Docker image for Valet:
> $ docker login ghcr.io/valet-customers/valet-cli

>Username: **your-github-handle**

>Password: **your github personal access token here**

expected output:
```
Username: <your-github-handle>
Password: *******
WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /home/codespace/.docker/config.json.
Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store
  ```

Next we pull the image to the local Codespace 

>$ docker pull ghcr.io/valet-customers/valet-cli

expected output:
```
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from valet-customers/valet-cli

Status: Downloaded newer image for ghcr.io/valet-customers/valet-cli:latest

```

Now we want to try to create some migrations of the Azure DevOps project that you can find in the Xpirit Repository (dev.azure.com/xpirit). 
The Team project name we can use for this exercise is **TailWindTraders**.

> note: please feel free to use your own Azure DevOps projects, the lab is more step by step prepared, feel free to go of script here!

Now go to the folder **valet** on your local repo in your codespaces IDE.
In this folder you find the Valet scripts. We already put them on the development environment, this is a step you **have** to take when you do this in the future on your own development environment. You can find this script in the valet/customer repo that you should have access to.
  
Try to run this script. 

If it fails with a security message, it is possible the file is not executable. For this run the command:
> chmod +x valet
This should mark it as executable on your local dev container.

Now run the command valet again.

It should now output the valet commands that are available:

```
Valet commands:
  valet audit                               # An audit will output a list of data used in a CI/CD instance.
  valet dry-run                             # Convert a pipeline to a GitHub Actions workflow and output it's yaml file.
  valet help [COMMAND]                      # Describe available commands or one specific command
  valet migrate                             # Convert a pipeline to a GitHub Actions workflow and open a pull request with the changes.
  valet upload-audit --audit-dir=AUDIT_DIR  # Upload the output of an audit for the Valet product team.
  valet version                             # valet version

Options:
      [--allowed-actions=one two three]                                      # An allowed list of GitHub actions to map to.
      [--allow-verified-actions], [--no-allow-verified-actions]              # Boolean value to only allow verified actions.
      [--allow-github-created-actions], [--no-allow-github-created-actions]  # Boolean value allowing only GitHub created actions.
      [--yaml-verbosity=YAML_VERBOSITY]                                      # YAML verbosity level.
                                                                             # Possible values: quiet, minimal, info
      [--custom-transformers=one two three]                                  # Paths to custom transformers.
  o, [--output-dir=OUTPUT_DIR]                                               # The location for any output files.
      [--credentials-file=CREDENTIALS_FILE]                                  # The file containing the credentials to use.
      [--no-telemetry], [--no-no-telemetry]                                  # Boolean value to disallow telemetry.
```
## Run an audit on the existing Azure DevOps project
To run Valet commands we need to pass in the arguments at each command or we can set up a file called .env.local. We provided this file already in the Valet folder. It is most convenient to use this file and only fill in the missing details for Azure DevOps and for GitHub. 
Add the following parameters to the file:
```
AZURE_DEVOPS_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token will be provided>
AZURE_DEVOPS_PROJECT=TailWindTraders
AZURE_DEVOPS_ORGANIZATION=xpirit
AZURE_DEVOPS_INSTANCE_URL=https://dev.azure.com/xpirit
```

Now run the following command:
> $ valet audit azure-devops --output-dir . 

This will run the tool with the options you specified in the .env.local file.

The output of this audit run will result in a set of files that got generated to become the future action workflows and a summary page that contains the output of the audit. 
Here you can see how the migration will happen and how successful it will be. Note not everything will be migrated and manual fixes are needed to succeed.
 
Inspect the file **audit_summary.md** and look at the results of the audit migration
  
# Execute the migration
Now we are going to migrate one of the successful pipelines. 
For this we need to make changes to the .env.local. file or pass in the arguments at the command line. 
Make changes to the .env.local. file and add the following parameters to the file:
  
```
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=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
GITHUB_INSTANCE_URL=https://github.com
```

Now we can run the command line and need to pass it the pipeline command. This command also requires to pass in a --target-url, which is the github repo you are targeting. This is the location https://github.com/Microsoft-Bootcamp/<your-repo-name> 
You also need the pipeline id of the Azure DevOps pipeline. You can fin this in the URL of the Azure DevOps project the moment you browse to the pipeline details. See the picture below where to find it:
  
![finding the pipeline id](images/pipeline-id.png)

Then we can run the following command to execute the migration:
> valet migrate azure-devops pipeline --target-url https://github.com/Microsoft-Bootcamp/<your-repo-name> --pipeline-id ###number from azdo pipeline###
You will find the following results:
```

[2021-09-14 11:45:08] Pull request: 'https://github.com/Microsoft-Bootcamp/your-repo/pull/xxx' 
 ```

The last line shows you a pull request that got created on the target repository that contains the migrated workflow.
This will look as follows:

![pull request](images/workflow-pullrequest.png)

Now inspect the pull request and the action workflow that is part of the pull request.
Accept the pull request and make a change to one of the files in the repository so you trigger the action workflow.

The result of the action workflow is a successful build that creates a set of artifacts that can be used to run a deployment workflow and pick up the artifacts.
