# Creating your first Action Workflow
1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.
2. In the `.github/workflows` directory, create a file named `github-actions-demo.yml`.
3. Copy the following YAML contents into the `github-actions-demo.yml` file:
```YAML
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select `Create` a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click `Propose new file`.

Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.
