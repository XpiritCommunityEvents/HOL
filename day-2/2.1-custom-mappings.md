# 2.1 Creating a custom mapping to override the default behavior or non existing mappings
In this hands on lab, you will learn to create a custom plugin that transforms some of the existing migration mapping and replace it by your own mapping. 
For this you need to start coding in Ruby.

## Creating a custom mapping
To create a mapping, you need to create a Ruby file that looks as follows:
``` ruby
transform "azuredevopstaskname" do |item|
   # your ruby code here that produces output
  end
```  
Create a new folder called `plugin` under the `valet` folder in your repository. In there create a files called `DotNetCoreCLI.rb`.

If we look at the transformation that was generated for our CI pipeline, we have seen the transformation does not take into account the fact we specified a wildcard pattern to match any of the csproj files we might have in our repo. This now results in a workflow that fails the build if we accept the default mapping.

Let's see if we can fix this by providing an alternative.

We start by changing the function name to match the Azure DevOps task name `DotNetCoreCLI@2`.
The way you find this name is by clicking the view yaml button at a task in the pipeline:
![view yaml](../images/view-yaml-task.png)

This results int he following code:
``` ruby
transform "DotNetCoreCLI@2" do |item|
   # your ruby code here that produces output
  end
```  
The parameter item is a collection of items than contain the properties of the original task that was retrieved from Azure DevOps.
In our case we can see in the yaml the properties that are set are e.g. `command` and `projects`.

This is what you can expect to find when we would dump the information. The way you can figure out what is in the item being passed you can do the following:
``` ruby
transform "DotNetCoreCLI@2" do |item|
   puts item
  end
```  
   
And then run a valet command line where we pass in the custom mapping like this, be sure to replace the path to the repo and the pipeline-id:

```
codespace ➜ /workspaces/attendee-demo/valet (main ✗) $
valet migrate azure-devops pipeline --target-url https://github.com/Microsoft-Bootcamp/attendee-<your-github-handle> --pipeline-id <definition-id> --custom-transformers plugin/DotNetCoreCLI.rb
```

the output will show the following:

[2021-09-14 21:40:08] Pull request: 'https://github.com/Microsoft-Bootcamp/test/pull/16'                                        
</pre>

Note the bold output, that is the result of our `puts item` statement.

Now that we know what we can expect in the item argument, lets see how we can change the output that now defaults to the use of the run command.

Lets make a code change to the ruby file and change it to this:
``` Ruby
transform "DotNetCoreCLI@2" do |item|
  projects = item["projects"]
  command = item['command']
  run_command = []
  
        if(projects.include?("$"))
          if(command.nil?)
            command = "build"
          end
           run_command << "shopt -s globstar; for f in ./**/*.csproj; do dotnet #{command} $f #{item['arguments'] } ; done"
        else
            run_command << "dotnet #{command} #{item['projects']} #{item['arguments'] }"
       end 
    {
      shell: "bash",
      run: run_command.join("\n")
    }
end
```
Run the transformation again and pass it the custom plugin. Look at the result and see if this results in a build that succeeds. 

> Note, You will see the build still fails. This is caused by the fact the environment variables that are set are in all uppercase and the reference to the context in the ${{}} references are in PascalCase. This results in the variable not being resolved. This is a known issue and is filed and on the backlog of the Valet team. Read more on this issue and how to solve it in [this FAQ item](https://github.com/Microsoft-Bootcamp/HOL/blob/main/faq.md#auto-generated-environment-variables-in-the-workflow-have-the-wrong-casing). 

As a final step, edit the workflow file and edit the file and replace all occurances of `${{ env.BuildConfiguration }}` with `${{ env.BUILDCONFIGURATION }}`
Now commit the file to the main branch and start the workflow again. Now you should have a succesful (green) build again.
